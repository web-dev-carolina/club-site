Web Dev Carolina's Website

This website aims to take advantage of the MEAN stack to showcase our organization's projects and community engagement. For styling, we are using bootstrap and our own custom CSS to create a personalized and interactive website.

The website has been broken down into several major components that different group members have been assigned to develop. The app-root calls all of the following components at the moment:
	app-top-bar,
	app-home,
	app-announcement,
	app-about-us,
	app-testimonial,
	app-project, and
	app-contact-us
